The research focuses on sentiment analysis using machine learning, comparing models like VADER, AFINN, BERT, and RoBERTa for analyzing Twitter data. The study analyzed tweets for nine movies over 2-6 months, evaluating neural networks (RNN, CNN) and transformer architectures. Key findings showed transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa) achieved superior precision and recall across sentiment categories. This research directly relates to his current work at Acer integrating GenAI and LLMs, as both involve NLP, transformer models, and AI-powered text analysis. The thesis is published on CSU ScholarWorks at scholarworks.calstate.edu/downloads/n8710030s and demonstrates expertise in NLP, sentiment analysis, machine learning, and social media data analysis.",
